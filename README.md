# Sprint Practice

**Contents:**
This repo contains bootcamp related sprints, organized by file. The purpose of this repo is to have every sprint in one location - to redo and improve code that was done during my junior phase of development. In these files you will see several comments narrating my problem solving process, as well as general concept notes.

**Usage:**
Each file system contains its own spec runner and dependencies. To view any specific sprint, cd into that directory and run:
* npm install
* npm start
